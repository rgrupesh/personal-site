JavaScript engine were orginally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded even in some servers, usually via [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). This evolution has made JavaScript a universal language.\n\n<h2>Whai is Full Stack Web Development?</h2>\n\nFull Stack is the development of both front end/client-side and back end/server-side. Full Stack Web Development can be divided into three major layers: presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer. Presentation layer handles UI/UX, business logic layer deals with dyanamic data processing, and data access layer provides data acesss through an API.\n\n![](three-layers.png)\n\n<h2>How to Become a Full Stack Web Developer?</h2>\n\nFirstly, developer should have knowledge of front end technologies like [ BootStrap ](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) in addition to HTML and CSS. Secondly, they should be equally good with backend tools like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and language like [Python](https://www.python.org/), [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet), [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#:~:text=Before%20the%20initial%20standardization%20in,level%20features%20for%20program%20organization.), [PHP](https://www.php.net/). Finally,they are also required to have knowledge of databases like [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [MYSQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) or [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).\n\n![](traditional.png)\n\nFurther, a Full Stack developer can specialize into one or many software stack.For instance:\n\n1:  MEAN Stack: MONGO | EXPRESS | ANGULAR| NODE\n\n2: MERN Stack: MONGO | EXPRESS | REACT| NODE\n\n3: MEVN Stack: MONGO | EXPRESS | VUE | NODE\n\n4: LAMP Stack: LINUX | APACHE | MYSQL | PHP\n\n5: Django Stack: JAVASCRIPT | PYTHON | DJANGO | MYSQL\n\n<h2>Javascript Full Stack</h2>\n\nLearning various languages can be cumbersome at times. This is where JavaScript comes in. In JavaScript Full Stack, presentaion layer is built using JavaScript frameworks, such as: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). Similarly, business logic layer is constructed with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and node-modules to communicate with front end using REST API serving JSON. Finally, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is used in data access layer.\n\n![](js.png)\n\nThere's trade-off everywhere. JavaScript Full Stack Web Dev is no exception.\n\n**Pros**\n- Prototype can be build rapidly.\n- Common language, better team efficiency with less resources.\n- Code reusability.\n- Can switch between front and back end development based on requirements.\n\n**Cons**\n- Node.js is not recommended for heavy backend computation and data processing.\n- Jack of all trades, master of none? May be.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"Full-Stack-JavaScipt.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","theme":"yeti","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Full Stack Web Development with JavaScript","image":"full-stack-javascript.jpg","date":"2020-07-24","author":"Rupesh Gelal","categories":["HTML/CSS","JavaScript","React","Vue","Node.js","Express","MongoDB"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
